# FAQ

### Q: How do I move shapes on the board?
A: Swiping up, down, left or right will move all the shapes on the board in that direction, if possible. Shapes will not move if there is no empty space in front of it, or if the shape can't merge into the shape in front of it.

### Q: How do I merge shapes?
A: Each swipe, two identical shapes will merge into the next shape tier when they collide into each other.

### Q: What are all the shapes tiers that exist?
A: There are **circles**, **triangles** and **squares**. Each shape has an '**open**' and '**full**' variant. 

### Q: How do I create a Tokiboo?
A:  You can continue to merge shapes into the next possible shape until they become full squares. Merging two full squares will clear all shapes in the same row and column of the position in which the squares are merged into. This is called a **Tokiboo**.

### Q: How do I collect points?
A: You get points for each swipe, merge and Tokiboo. All shapes removed by a Tokiboo grant bonus points. The number of Tokiboo created in a game increase the points granted for each swipe.

### Q: When does the game end?
A: If you swipe a full board and nothing can move or merge in the direction of the swipe, the game is over.
